            <h2>Testimonials</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>&#8220;Dear Lilli Ann, thank you, for all of your boundless energy, enthusiasm, and good cheer. You're a dancing version of the energizer bunny!</strong></p>
                <p>I first met you at a "Dancing Till Dusk" event a few years ago  &mdash; your energy struck me right away. When you described your Dance for Joy! classes and events, my first jaded reaction was 'boy, she needs a name with more pizazz or something' ... but after a couple years of basking in the glow of the amazing local dance community, where you always seem to be close to the center, I completely 'get it'!!! (Duh... that's what dancing is all about!)</p>
                <p>I think Kathie and I took our first waltz classes with you &mdash; because of DTD &mdash; wow, did I have two left feet.</p>
                <p>Thanks so much for all the love and encouragement you've given to the dance community!&#8221; <cite>&mdash;&nbsp;Peter</cite></p>

                <blockquote>
                <p><strong>&#8220;Hi Lilli Ann! I wanted to thank you SO much for the opportunity to help out &amp; attend the Cornucopia Ball.</strong> I was in awe of what a wonderful evening it was. Without your vision, passion and love for creating such magic with music &amp; dance, these kinds of events would never be happening. You are a true romantic and you have an exquisite, signature 'touch' that just seems to permeate everything you put your hand to. We are a very blessed to have you as such an integral part of the Seattle dance community.</p>
                <p>Again &mdash; thank you. It was a beautiful evening! I hope you got a good night's rest!&#8221;

                <p><strong>&#8220;Hi Lilli Ann, I don't know if you remember me, but I was in your Waltz 2 just this past session and I just wanted to say thank you for having me and my partner in your class.</strong> I didn't get a chance to say it at your last class because you had another class starting immediately after us, so I'm saying it now. We had a wonderful time and your classes helped get rid of my fear of dancing. Again, thank you so much for teaching and I can't wait to get back into it!&#8221;

                <p><strong>&#8220;This is my second Swing I and I'm taking Swing 2 right after. TIRED after 2 hours but I love it.</strong> I plan on taking Waltz next. You are a great organization, and wonderful teachers! I have a couple friends taking Swing I with me this time, both have taken other classes, and both think you are so much better than their previous experiences. I'm very glad I found you!&#8221; <cite><em>&mdash;Susan&nbsp;Larson</em></cite></p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>&#8220;Dear Lilli Ann, we are both enjoying the classes. </strong>We have taken a few other dance classes in past years, and we appreciate the things we have received in our other classes, but there is no doubt in our minds that your classes are the best organized, best taught and most enjoyable we have experienced. Thanks.&#8221; <cite><em>&mdash;Scott&nbsp;Henrickson</em></cite></p>
